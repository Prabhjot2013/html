        <p>The non-government members of the Manitoba Hydro-Electric board have resigned, stating that they’ve suffered from a lack of dialogue with government.</p>
        <p>According to Manitoba Hydro’s website, that means the only board member to not resign is Tory MLA Cliff Graydon.</p>
        <p>Board chair Sanford Riley issued a statement on behalf of board members Dave Brown, Earl Edmondson, Steve Kroft, Jennefer Nepinak, Michael Pyle, Allen Snyder, Dayna Spiring and Dr. Annette Trimbee. 
        <p>“Earlier today we wrote to the Hon. Cliff Cullen, Minister of Crown Services, informing him of our resignation from the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board, effective immediately. 
        <p>For over a year, we have attempted to meet with the Premier to resolve a number of critical issues related to the finances and governance of Manitoba Hydro, including matters related to Hydro’s efforts to further develop its relationship with Indigenous peoples,” the statement says. </p>“Despite repeated attempts we have not been able to have a meaningful dialogue with the government and we have reached an impasse. We have been informed the government intends to remove the chair and has therefore lost confidence in the board.”</p>
        <p>“Accordingly, we have determined that it is necessary to resign. We wish to thank the management and staff of Manitoba Hydro for their support and commitment during our time as board members.</p>
        <p>They are committed to Manitoba Hydro’s long-term success and financial health. It has been an honour to work with them and we wish them all the best in the future.”</p>
